Since I had no previous knowledge with tests, the first hours I've spent learning about **unit tests** and **TDD**.  
Then, I've started to think about my problem and what bad entries my function could receive and wrote some tests.  
After that I've started to write my function with a **list approach**. It was not the best solution and I didn't liked, so
I tought about how could I do it with a **dictionary approach**. Turns out it went * **far better** * than the list approach and I've decided to maintain that last.
